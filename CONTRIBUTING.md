## Installing and compiling source

First you will have to install node_modules through npm

```shell
npm install
```

To compile to the source code, you have to execute the build task through visual studio code.
First you need to invoke to quick command (on MacOS `âŒ˜P`, while on Linux/windows is `ctrl+p`)
then type `task build` and wait until VSC will have finished the task.

### Testing the theme

To test the theme, you will have to go to the debug section, select the *Launch Extension* from debug and execute it.

### Adding new Material Theme commands

Material Theme commands are located inside the `extensions/commands` directory. They are split by folders so you can find a single specific `index.ts` file inside a `command` folder. This is a patter choice: so you can add related command helpers inside that folder.

#### index.ts

The main file must return a `function`. The `function` can be `async` or `sync`.

We want to make this clear, so the `async` declaration must be present even if you want to use `then()` for chaining inside the `function`.

##### Example of `async` exported `function`

```js
export default async (): Promise<boolean> => {

    ...
```

##### Example of `sync` exported `function`

```js
export default (): boolean => {

    ...
```

#### Using external "mini" modules

We encourage you to split up your command in other small modules so they can be **tested** more easily and outside of the context.

#### Register the command

You must register the new command to execute it when it's called by the user.

Firstly add the command to our commands `extensions/commands/index.ts`

```js
export {default as awesomeCommand} from './awesome-command';
```

Commands are registered within the `extensions/material.theme.config.ts` file.

Just add a new registration after the others that will run your command:

```js

  Commands.registerCommand('materialTheme.awesomeCommand', () => ThemeCommands.awesomeCommand());

```

#### Add to package.json

When you are ready to test your new command you must add its declaration within the `package.json`. The command **must be prefixed with** `materialTheme.` prefix.

As the others your command will look like this:

Level: `contribute.commands -> Array`
```json

      {
        "command": "materialTheme.awesomeCommand",
        "title": "Awesome Title For Command",
        "category": "Material Theme"
      }

```

#### Build and run

Now you can re-build the theme and just run the debug, you will see your command in the command list of VSCode just searching for its title.
