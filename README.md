This is a fork of the Material Theme by Mattia Astorino (Equinusocio) with the following changes:

* Notification popups, deleted with extreme prejudice
* Frivolous dependencies, dropped
* Emojis in the command palette, cleaned up

The end result is the exact same color theme, but with less annoyances and bloat.
